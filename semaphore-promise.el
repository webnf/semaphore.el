;;; Commentary:

;; semaphore-gated-promise uses semaphore to implement a sort of
;; thread pool for promises

;;; Code:

(require 'semaphore)
(require 'promise)

(defun semaphore-promise-gated (semaphore handler)
  "Create a promise based on handler, like promise-new, but
   acquire and release the semaphore around resolving the
   handler (+ result promises).

   This is useful for controlling parallelism in asynchronous work flows:
   e.g. if you want to fetch 10000 files, but only 7 at a time:

   (let ((s (semaphore-create 7)))
     (promise-all
       (mapcar
         (lambda (url)
           (semaphore-promise-gated s
             (lambda (resolve _)
               (resolve (http-get url))))) ;; assuming http-get returns another promise
         url-list))"
  (if semaphore
      (promise-finally
       (promise-new
        (lambda (resolve reject)
          (semaphore-acquire semaphore)
          (funcall handler resolve reject)))
       (lambda ()
         (semaphore-release semaphore)))
    (promise-new handler)))
